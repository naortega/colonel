This is a small OS project I'm working on. It's slow progress and
probably shouldn't be run anywhere except in an emulator. It currently
supports the following architectures:
 - x86

# Compiling
-----------
You'll want to setup a cross-compilation toolchain with GCC
(https://gcc.gnu.org/) and the GNU Binutils
(https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) for your target architecture,
as well as the CMake build system (https://cmake.org/). You can test
the kernel in QEMU (https://www.qemu.org/) using the `-kernel' option.

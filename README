This is a small OS project I'm working on. It's slow progress and
probably shouldn't be run anywhere except in an emulator. It currently
supports the following architectures:

 - x86

# Compiling
-----------
This project uses Clang (https://clang.llvm.org/) and NASM
(http://www.nasm.us/) for building. You will also require GNU Make
(https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), unless you want to manually go
through and compile the files.

To compile a full image you can run `make build-iso`, which will use
GNU GRUB (https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) as the bootloader. Else,
just run `make` and it will build the kernel into a file called
`colonel.bin`. You can run the latter with QEMU (https://www.qemu.org/)
by using the `-kernel` option.
